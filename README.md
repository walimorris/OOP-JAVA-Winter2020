# OOP-JAVA-Winter2020

***Object Oriented Programming course*** 

***Below are some of the assignments I've worked on this quarter***

***Introduction Challenge: Creating a Rocket***
This exercise was introduced in our first class and seemed really cool. Some things I've learned: 
at first I didn't think Java would allow me to concatenate strings and although it doesn't show 
in this program, I did experiment with a few different options. For example, creating the drawTri()
method I decided to declare two variables( forSlash = "/" and backSlash "\\"). With this I thought 
I could then concatenate forSlash + backSlash to create "/\" for the top of the rocket. I was surprised
when it actually worked. I decided to replace these methods because it didn't seem to be a good design. 
I still don't fully understand the main function(), placing args in public static void main(String[] args): 
What is its purpose?
