# OOP-JAVA-Winter2020

***Object Oriented Programming course*** 

***Below are some of the assignments I've worked on this quarter***

***Introduction Challenge: Creating a Rocket***
This exercise was introduced in our first class and seemed really cool. Some things I've learned: 
at first I didn't think Java would allow me to concatenate strings(easily, that is) and although 
it doesn't show in this program, I did experiment with a few different options. For example, creating
the drawTri() method I decided to declare two variables( forSlash = "/" and backSlash "\\"). With 
this I thought I could then concatenate forSlash + backSlash to create "/\\" for the top of the rocket.
I was surprised when it actually worked. I decided to replace these methods because it didn't seem to 
be a good design. Questions: I still don't fully understand the main function()
public static void main(String[] args)----- What is the purpose of args?
